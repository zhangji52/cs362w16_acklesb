It was extremely difficult to get my unit test as well as cardtests to run or even compile. It took editing of
the dominion.c to get it to final work. There was a missing bracket. There were also many mistakes in my code,
that needed to be fixed. unittest3 as well as cardtest1-4 all have implicit declaration problems.

However i finally got my code to compile. I used Gcov and all my unit tests have 100% coverage this makes sense because
it should run every line. There aren't any loops or jumps so every line will be run. I had trouble getting my code to run without
segfault, it turned out to be because the seed that was being passed to initializeGame and the beginning of every test. I was using
the command line to get that and then wasn't actually using the command line so i just have it generate a random seed now in
its place.

There were many bugs that i found where assert would trip after 3 or for runs of a for loops. Even though the code should still return the
same value after each one. However all of the bad cases failed appropriately. I did not understand how the function getCost worked
It took an int and compared it in a switch case as a string. So I don't know how that works. I also am not entirely sure i was
accessing the gameState struct correctly.
