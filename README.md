My project is in the folder Final Project.
From there all my dominion code is in the directory, other students code i reviewed is in folders with their name
respectively. The files that directly go with the final example such as the bug reports, debugging.txt, inspection.txt,
and testreport are all in the folder "Main Files for Final Project".
