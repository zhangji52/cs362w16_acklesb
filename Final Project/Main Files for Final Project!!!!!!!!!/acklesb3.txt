Bug Report Two:

Sophia Liu, dominion.c
	In the baron part of the switch statement. When a baron card is selected the program is sent ary,
	the number of buys is never incremented which throws off the buying phase. Making it harder for that player to win
	or if they are extremely unfortunate then they might not be able to complete the game at all. If theplayer ends up with
	to many baron cards since the number of buys is never incremented they might not be able to buy any cards which influcence their
	ability to play. I found this buy by using my whole game tester which showed weird buying activity when i ran it randomly through her
	code. I then deduced it was from baron and ran a card tester on baron to see why it was acting weird. Showing that the number
	of buys was never changed, i knew there was something wrong with that, after checking the way dominion the game is supposed to work
	as well as my own implementation I found that numbuys was never increased for baron. This bug is around line 838 in dominion.c.
	
	This is a high priroity bug because it effects the buying phase of the program. It won't increment the amount of buyin that can happen
	which totally messes the game up and makes it nearly impossible to move forward. If it happens. Although it is unlikely to happen it
	is a high severity because it can destroy the game play.
