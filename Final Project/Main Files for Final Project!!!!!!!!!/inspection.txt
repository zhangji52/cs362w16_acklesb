Option C: Code inspection

Participants: Sophia Liu, Christian Armatas

Firstly, I'm not entirely sure what how to formate this report, so I'm just going to go with it.

Inspection of Sophia's Code:
In Sophia's buyCard function there is a problem with changing the position/location of the card once it is drawn.
There are a few lines commented out that prevent the card from actually being discarded. Currently the commented 
line will draw a card from the deck and put in to the discard pile instead of in to the current players hand. This
is obvious a problem because the card is one wasted and the player never gets a card but still gets the cost of the card subtracted
from the coins the player has. This can cause the game to be in-completable. This is actually a really easy fix and I
don't know how I didn't catch this sooner because it messes with the entire game and is very obvious when scrolling
through that all you need to do is uncomment the line and the line and change the 3rd variable to 2 instead of 0.
This will actually move the card as well as move it the the current players hand instead of to the discard pile.
//state->supplyCount[supplyPos]--;
//gainCard(supplyPos, state, 0, who);
Should be changed too:
state->supplyCount[supplyPos]--;
gainCard(supplyPos, state, 2, who);
I found this by using delta debugging to find out why the hand would end up empty after a few steps through the game.


Inspection of Christian's Code:
In Christian's code the initialize function has a bug. I do not know it it was on purpose or on accident but around like
168 when drawing cards in the players hand. The for loop that draws the 5 cards is commented out so the players hand never
gets any cards. This is a very easy bug to solve, simply uncomment the 4 lines that let the initialize function draw cards.
With cards in the players hand there is not really a way to start the game. This would also explain why there was terrible
code coverage in the part 4 of the project. Because the hand was never getting initialized. After looking at it for so long
I never found the bug until I finally decided to look at the initialize function, I figured that would be the function that
no one would touch and could assume correct. I was wrong. So because of this the hand count is never anything besides 0 and
there are initially 0 cards in the players hand. After the first players turn though everyone gets there hands filled and the
game plays as normal. So this just affects the first turn of the game.

Inspection of my code from Sophia and Christian:
Sophia and Christian both found bugs I purposely created at the beginning of the term in assignment 1. They both found that in
my remodel function I flipped a > to be < in the first if statement that would check if the player had the ability to play remodel
during that play. Causing it to fail when it should work and work when it should fail. This is very bad because it throws the entire game
in to chaos.
Sophia found that in my greatHallFunc I changed a variable that is hard coded in to pass to discardCard. The original line was:
discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 2);
Which was changed to:
discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 3);
This is changing the handpos of the card to discard so the wrong card gets put in the discard pile. Which screws with the players hand because they
then do not have a card that they did not play.

This code inspection was not a complete inspection, it was mearly a dive in inspection to find a bug or two and report
them and there place to the developer. This is a very useful type of inspection because it does not require the inspector
and developer to be in the same place and also allows more freedom when it comes to testing and how bugs are found. It is also
more likely to reveal real world bugs instead of lab bugs.
