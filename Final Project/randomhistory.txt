Salvager Function:
	When testing the salvager function I couldn't find anything wrong with it. It always seemed
	to work. Running 2000 tests it still seems to pass almost every time. Hardly any edge cases where found.
	The coverage of the randomtestcard is about 63%. So a decent percentage of lines are executed. In order to get more
	coverage going to the function instead of the switch statement got more lines executed because the function was expanded.
	Also adding a case for negative values increased code coverage.
	
Adventurer Card:
	The adventurer card wasn't as bullet proof a function as the salvager function. It had some more problems.
	This could be due to the fact that its in the card effect function instead of in its own function like salvager,
	because it was one of the functions we had to rewrite. The function had about 60% execution of lines. There
	can be a case where an infinite loop comes if the the came doesn't have enough treasure cards.
