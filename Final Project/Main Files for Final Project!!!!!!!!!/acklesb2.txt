Bug Report Two:

Sophia Liu, dominion.c
	In the villageFunc after drawing a card the current players state for numactions is never changed. I didn't need any tools to find
	this, just after looking over the code. knowing that there would be a bug in a specific area of the code. I was able to see that the
	line just repeats its self and sets its self back to its self so knowing this won't do anything it is innately a bug. After looking
	up what village is supposed to do it should be adding 2 to the numactions after drawing cards. This bug is located in the villageFunc
	around line 683.
	
	This is a low priroity bug because it doesn't hurt the game play it just makes it more difficult to win. It doesn't making it
	impossible to win it will just take longer and because of this it has a medium severity. That is because completing the game is
	kind of the point of a game.
